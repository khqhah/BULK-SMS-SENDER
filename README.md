Application Description
Title: SMS Sender App with .NET MAUI

Overview: The SMS Sender App is a cross-platform mobile application built using .NET MAUI, designed to send SMS messages directly from within the app without requiring the user to open the default SMS application on their device. This app utilizes platform-specific implementations to send SMS messages on Android devices seamlessly.

Key Features:

Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Developed using .NET MAUI, this application runs on multiple platforms, including Android and iOS. However, the core functionality of sending SMS messages is implemented specifically for Android.
Direct SMS Sending:

The app allows users to send SMS messages directly from within the app interface. The message is sent using Android's SmsManager, bypassing the need to open the default SMS app.
Dependency Injection:

The app leverages .NET MAUI's dependency injection capabilities to manage services like ISmsSender, which abstracts the SMS sending functionality. The dependency injection is configured using a static service provider to allow easy access to services in the shared project without requiring constructor injection.
Simple User Interface:

The user interface is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing users to send a message with just a few taps. The main page contains a button that, when clicked, sends an SMS to a predefined recipient with a predefined message.
Platform-Specific Implementation:

The SMS sending functionality is implemented specifically for Android. The shared project defines the interface ISmsSender, and the Android project provides the concrete implementation. The app is structured to allow easy extension to other platforms if needed.
Automatic Permission Handling:

The app includes functionality to request necessary permissions (such as sending SMS) at runtime, ensuring that the user grants the required permissions before the app attempts to send a message.
Technical Details:

.NET MAUI: The app is built using .NET MAUI, Microsoft's framework for creating cross-platform applications with a single codebase.
Dependency Injection: The app uses .NET MAUI's built-in dependency injection to manage service lifetimes and provide platform-specific implementations.
Android Implementation: For Android, the SmsSender class implements the ISmsSender interface and uses Android's SmsManager to send SMS messages.
Use Case: This application is ideal for users or developers looking to understand how to implement platform-specific functionalities within a cross-platform .NET MAUI application. It serves as an example of integrating native device capabilities into a shared codebase, offering a foundation for more complex cross-platform mobile applications.
